We were tasked with analyzing the run-time and memory for a vector, hash table, and BST. The purpose of the code would be to store and categorize classes for a fake university. 
The code also needed to be able to show the prerequisites for the courses and organize them in alphanumeric order. I determined that the vector would be the best way to sort these
and designed the code in order to do that. The code included here is the vector sorting that I developed. I think that the code does a good job of sorting the information and the
menu is easy to operate for the user. When writing the code and testing it, I kept trying menu options that were not part of the menu and my code kept crashing. It took me a while to
include the proper catches in order to return to the question rather than having the code just repeat issues to the user. This work has shown me that there are multiple ways to approach every problem.
Even if the code does what it is intended to do, it may not be the best version of that code. However, the principles of coding remain the same and even if I need to change the type
or structure of my code, I can reuse a lot of what I have already done rather than starting from scratch. Alos, I have learned that it may be better to comment on my code more than I think
is needed. If I explain the thought process around what I'm doing, it will be easier for someone else to come in and help perfect my code in the future as we build.
